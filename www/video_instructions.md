# Video-only ratings

The following sections consists in detecting and rating laughter **without audio** (ie. **the videos are now muted**). For each short video there are two tasks to complete:

1. Recognition: you will have to press a key (q) when you perceive laughter to be happening in the video.
2. Rating: if you thought there was laughter, we ask you to rate the intensity of the laughter and your confidence that there was or was not laughter.

<div class="md-block info">
<ul>
<li><strong>We want to capture your "gut feeling" about laughter. In the recognition task, do not worry about pressing the key too late, some delay is normal.</strong></li>
<li>You may repeat the recognition task once if you made an important mistake.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<!-- ### 1. Recognition

1. Play the video by pressing the spacebar. Make sure to bring the window into focus if it doesn't work.
2. Press "q" when you perceive laughter to be ocurring. Keep "q" pressed until the laughter stops, and press it again if it resumes. In other words, the key should be down when laughter is ocurring and up when laughter is not ocurring. Submit the results and move on if you are satisfied. You can also choose to re-annotate the segment.

### 2. Rating
1. Provide your rating of laughter intensity on the right. You may play the video once more before rating it. Please watch the examples below to understand what are low-intensity and high-intensity laughs. 
2. Provide a rating of confidence. This value should be about your confidence that laughter did or did not occur in the video. It should be highest if you are absolutely certain that laughter occured or did not occur, lowest if you are not at all certain. -->



## Important training phase: please watch!

> The following are examples of no laughter, low intensity laughter, and high intensity laughter sourced from the dataset. We hope that these will help you understand what to expect from this task and calibrate your ratings of laughter intensity.
