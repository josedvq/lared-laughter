# Video-only ratings

Welcome!

The following sections consists in rating recordings of laughter in social interaction. For each laughter recording there are two tasks to complete:

### 1. Recognition

1. Play the video by pressing the spacebar. Make sure to bring the window into focus if it doesn't work.
2. Press "q" when you perceive laughter to be ocurring. Keep "q" pressed until the laughter stops, and press it again if it resumes. In other words, the key should be down when laughter is ocurring and up when laughter is not ocurring. Submit the results and move on if you are satisfied. You can also choose to re-annotate the segment.

### 2. Rating
1. Provide your rating of laughter intensity on the right. You may play the video once more before rating it. Please watch the examples below to understand what are low-intensity and high-intensity laughs. 
2. Provide a rating of confidence. This value should be about your confidence that laughter did or did not occur in the video. It should be highest if you are absolutely certain that laughter occured or did not occur, lowest if you are not at all certain.

<li>If you are not completely sure but you think you might see laughter, we want you to annotate it as laughter</li>
<li>In recognition, <strong>don't worry about pressing / releasing the key too late.</strong> Response time will be taken into account.</li>
<li>Make sure to maximize your browser window before you start annotating.</li>

## Important training phase: please watch!

> The following are examples of no laughter, low intensity laughter, and high intensity laughter sourced from the dataset. We expect that these will help you understand what to expect from this task and calibrate your ratings of laughter intensity. Note that without access to all modalities it might be hard to perceive the intensity of the laughs and that is okay.
