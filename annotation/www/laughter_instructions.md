# General instructions

Welcome!

The following sections consists in rating short recordings (approx 7 seconds each) of laughter in social interaction. Although many of the recordings contain laughter, not all of them do, and your job will be to indicate which ones you think contain laughter, and which ones do not. **For each short video** there are two tasks to complete:

1. Recognition: you will have to press a key (q) when you perceive laughter to be happening in the video.
2. Rating: if you thought there was laughter, we ask you to rate the intensity of the laughter and your confidence that there was or was not laughter.

<ul>
<li><strong>We want to capture your gut feeling about laughter. Do not worry about your work being perfect. Many of the videos are challenging.</strong></li>
<li>Make sure to maximize your browser window before you start annotating.</li>
<li>Make sure you have headphones at hand. You will need to listen to audio.</li>
</ul>

The whole experiment is divided into four sections:
- **Examples (3 videos)**: These are three videos with clear laughter for you to familiarize yourself with the task.
- **Video-only (40 videos)**, where the videos contain **no audio**. You'll have to pay attention to the body movements to try to determine if there is laughter.
- **Audiovisual (40 videos)**, where the videos contain audio.
- **Audio-only (40 videos)**, where you can only listen to the laughter but not see the person.

You will also encounter a few tasks designed to measure your reaction time.
