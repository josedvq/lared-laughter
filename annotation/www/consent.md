### Declaration of Informed Consent: Cross-modal differences in annotation of conversation quality constructs

To participate in the following study, you must read and declare your agreement to the following items:

1. The purpose of this study is to understand differences in annotation of audiovisual recordings of conversations when different modalities (audio and video) are not available or available only in limited form. Your participation consists in watching and/or listening to media files containing people engaged in conversation in a web interface, where you will be asked to rate variables related to conversation quality (eg. enjoyment, engagement) and/or indicate the occurrence of actions (eg. laughter, nodding, gesturing) for a target subject in the video by using the interface or pressing keyboard keys.
2. We will not collect any kind of personal information and your identity will not be stored. We will store the annotations that you provide for the purpose of analysis. This includes the answers to the questions about the media segments that you will be watching. We may store variables captured during your interaction with the annotation tool, including logs of the position of your mouse, and events triggered using your mouse or keyboard (eg. pausing/playing the video). These variables are only (and can only) be recorded while you interact with our tool, and not with other browser tabs or applications and are recorded with the purpose of analyzing the annotation process and improving the annotation tool.
3. The data will be stored indefinitely, to be accessed by the Socially Perceptive Computing Lab members. The recorded data will not be made freely available to the general public. Data may be shared with other researchers in the research community, only in the case of research that is substantially similar in purpose to the goal of this research project and only if these parties comply with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Any researchers requesting access to the data will be required to sign an End-User License Agreement (EULA) agreeing to keep the data private and to the responsible use of the data, as well as compliance with the GDPR.
4. You understand that your participation in this experiment is voluntary. You have the right to withdraw from the experiment at any time during its execution by closing the browser window. Incomplete data will be deleted automatically. Withdrawal after completion of the experiment is not possible as the data will be stored completely anonymously (ie. we cannot link it back to your identity).
5. Funding for this project is provided by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) under project number 639.022.606.
